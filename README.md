# ASM_Linux32
Basic ASM programs heavily commented for learning purposes.

Some of these programs may not appear to do anything, however are intended to be used with a disassembler (personally GDB is used, as may be seen within the comments). This should be stated within the code as and when neccesary what exactly was done and why. 

These were developed and run on a 32 bit Ubuntu machine.
